;;; Commentary:

;; Provides asynchronous versions of the following operations:
;;
;;   Function                 Command equivalent
;;   -----------------------  ---------------------------------
;;   copy-file                cp
;;   copy-directory           cp -R
;;   rename-file              mv
;;   delete-file              rm
;;   delete-directory         rm -r
;;
;; Additional features:
;;
;; - If `async-file-use-native-commands' is non-nil, and none of the files
;;   involved are `file-remote-p', the native command equivalents are used
;;   above rather than spawning a child Emacs to call the related function.
;;
;; - Operations are queued, so that only one asynchronous operation is
;;   performed at one time.  If an error occurs while processing the queue,
;;   the whole queue is aborted.
